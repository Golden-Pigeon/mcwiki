  - [0x68 window items](https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Window_items_.280x68.29)

- From 1.9pre2 onward, additional data is sent but only for [certain item_ids](https://gist.github.com/1268479). This means the protocol is no longer context free. The additional data is *at least* a short. If this short isn't -1, a byte[] array follows, containing *gzipped* NBT data

``

` COMPOUND   LIST: 'ench'     SHORT: 'id'     SHORT: 'lvl'   END END ```
